⚠️ **ALPHA BUILD** ⚠️

# *Guitar Pro 8* on Linux

Install *Guitar Pro 8* on Linux through Wine and Wineget.

Note: This is a full rework of the forked repository. It only uses the core install functionality from it.

## Installation

Run the [`install`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Guitar-Pro-On-Linux/raw/refs/heads/main/install) script.

To install, run:

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://nikoboinftb.github.io/shell/gp8/install)
```

It will clone/update this repository locally, allowing for easy file copying.

The `install` script runs the `build` script automatically, which actually builds the app.

## Updating

Running `build` or the command above again will fully re-install *Guitar Pro 8* from scratch and should update all included files from this repository.

## Reset

The `reset` script will wipe the registry and config files of the installation. This is useful if Guitar Pro "breaks" (*wink*).
