# Guitar Pro 8 On Linux

This is the repository on the shell script to install Guitar Pro 8 on linux through Wine.

Very simple script since Guitar Pro 8 requires only corefonts to run properly on Wine.

For any request or problem open an issue

## Usage

To install, run:

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://nikoboinftb.github.io/sh/gp8/install)
```

## Updating

I will eventually make the install script automatically reset the 7 day trial.
